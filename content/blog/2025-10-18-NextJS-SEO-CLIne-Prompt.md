I ran this in CLIne for this site and I honestly think it may have helped. I don't know. I don't really care anymore. All I know is that it did not break it.

```
Core Objectives
Add and refine SEO metadata for every page and post.
Improve semantic HTML and add structured data (JSON-LD).
Optimize images, fonts, performance & Core Web Vitals.
Generate and configure sitemap and robots.txt.
Ensure clean URLs, canonical tags, no duplicate content.
Verify improvements via logs, Lighthouse, and automated checks.
Review /pages or /app directory structure.
Detect if using Pages Router or App Router.
Identify blog post generation (Markdown, MDX, CMS, etc.).
Create a TODO.md or SEO_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md to track progress.
Metadata System Implementation
For Pages Router:
Add/import <Head> from next/head in all pages.
For App Router (Next.js 13+):
Use export const metadata = {} or generateMetadata() for dynamic pages.
Each page must include:
Title (‚â§ 60 characters, keyword-focused).
Meta description (‚â§ 160 characters, compelling).
Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url).
Twitter Card tags.
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/...">.
For dynamic routes ([slug].tsx), generate metadata from post content.
3. Semantic HTML + Structured Data (JSON-LD)
Replace generic <div>s with semantic elements: <article>, <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <section>.
Add JSON-LD using <script type="application/ld+json"> for:
Blog posts ‚Üí "@type": "Article"
Homepage ‚Üí "@type": "WebSite"
About page ‚Üí "@type": "Person" or "Organization"
Validate structured data using https://search.google.com/test/rich-results.
4. Image & Media Optimization
Replace all <img> with Next.js <Image />.
Ensure:
alt text is descriptive & keyword-relevant.
Images are automatically responsive and lazy-loaded.
Prefer modern formats like WebP.
5. Performance / Core Web Vitals Enhancements
Use next/font instead of external CSS font imports.
Audit third-party scripts; load via <Script strategy="lazyOnload" /> or afterInteractive.
Remove render-blocking scripts/styles.
Enable Static Site Generation wherever possible.
Use dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false }) where interactive-only.
6. Sitemaps, robots.txt, and Crawl Control
Install and configure next-sitemap.
Generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt automatically.
Add canonical base URL in config.
Add noindex to pages like /admin, /dashboard, /drafts.
7. Clean URLs & Avoid Duplicate Content
Ensure URL structure is lowercase, hyphen-separated (/blog/my-post-title).
Add 301 redirect from http ‚Üí https, and non-www ‚Üí www or vice versa.
Use canonical tags for paginated or duplicate content.
If pagination exists, add rel="next" and rel="prev".
8. Monitoring & Validation
Add commands to run Lighthouse and output reports to /seo-reports.
Validate metadata output by crawling the site locally.
Fix 404 errors, broken links, missing alt text, wrong status codes.
Log all SEO changes in SEO_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md.
Be isolated to one logical SEO change.
Final Requirement
When SEO optimization is complete:
Provide a summary of changes.
Provide a checklist of unresolved items.
Do NOT break any existing functionality or styling.
Ensure site builds and deploys successfully.
```
