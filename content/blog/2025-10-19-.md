In [part one](https://danielkliewer.com/blog/2025-10-19-building-a-local-llm-powered-knowledge-graph) I started a vibe coding session with just a vauge idea we and created the [following repo](https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/mindmap03/tree/master) using a single prompt.

So what I am doing now is I cloned the repo:

<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/mindmap04.git
```

<br>

Kind of embarassing but where we left off in the last post was not really finished.

It is not really even close to being finished really. There is still a lot to do.

So I am doing some fixes right now but once I finish that I hope to have a repo that works a bit better before we start analyzing it in more detail and finish the project.

But you know what. I am tired. I have been awake for a long time and I need a nap.
